# CINEFLIX Assessment project for Startup Bakery Lab SRL

This project was developed as an assessment for Stratup Bakery Lab SRL. It is a React + Vite + Typescript web app to search, save and rate movies!

## Installation

- The first thing to do after downloading and extracting all project files, is installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). It will automatically include npm, to write every command you need.

- In your command prompt, move to the main directory of the project you downloaded and type

```cmd
npm install
```

or

```cmd
npm i
```

One of the two commands (choose your favourite) will add the node_modules folder with all the necessary dependencies to make the web app work

- Finally, after the previous command finishes its execution, type

```cmd
npm run dev
```

to actually start the web app locally on your computer.

- Open your browser and go to [this](http://localhost:5173) URL to open the web app

- That's it. Enjoy :-)
